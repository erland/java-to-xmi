# samples/mini

A tiny Java source tree used for local smoke testing of the `java-to-xmi` CLI.

It is intentionally not a Maven/Gradle project—just a folder with Java files.

Layout:
- `src/main/java/...` contains a tiny app
- `src/test/java/...` contains a minimal test file used to validate `--exclude-tests`
